## 📈 Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM 🚀

### 📊 Business Use Case

This project helps investors and financial analysts make informed decisions by utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict Tesla's stock prices. By leveraging historical market data, the model forecasts stock prices, allowing stakeholders to anticipate trends and optimize their investment strategies in the volatile stock market.

### 🔍 Project Description
The financial market, especially with Tesla, is highly volatile, making accurate predictions valuable for minimizing risks. This project uses LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels in capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data, to predict future Tesla stock prices based on past patterns and trends.

This project can assist investors by:

* 📅 Analyzing historical stock prices and trends.
* 📈 Predicting future stock price movements.
* 💼 Assisting in formulating data-driven investment strategies.

### 🔧 Features
* 🧹 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and transforming historical stock data.
* 🔄 LSTM Model: Training an LSTM network to predict future stock prices.
* 📏 Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) to measure model performance.
* 📊 Visualization: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices to evaluate the model’s predictions.

### 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the jupyter notebook

### 🧠 Model Architecture
* LSTM Layers: To capture temporal dependencies from historical stock prices.
* Dense Layer: For final prediction output.
* Loss Function: Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to minimize prediction error.
